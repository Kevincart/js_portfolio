## Projects
### Food Finder
A simple quick app for finding restaurants near you.
Uses Javascript with jQuery with the Google Places API.

[See the app in action here](https://kevincartwright.herokuapp.com/)
This version is currently running on a custom Node.js server I have written.

### LinkAnim
This is a javascript demo, demonstrating usage of javascript to animate a character sprite from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda. The code creates a CSS-defined button that allows direction change.
